## XtendM3 Workshop
Last Thursday each month, two workshops are held. Track A between 10-11 CEST, and Track B between 15-16 CEST. During these workshops we go over highlights or latest released features for XtendM3 and topics requested in the Teams Community or last workshop. At the end of each workshop we have a round table session where the floor is open to any questions, discussions or requests.

## XtendM3 Teams Community
In Microsoft Teams, we have a Team setup named __*XtendM3 Community*__. This channel is used for several things. Recordings of Workshops and Workshop presentations uploaded as PDFs. XtendM3 Support. Feature requests for XtendM3. Topic Request for XtendM3 Workshops.
