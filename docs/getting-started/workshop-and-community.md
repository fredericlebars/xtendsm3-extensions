## XtendM3 Workshop
Last Thursday each month, two workshops are held. Track A between 10-11 CEST, and Track B between 15-16 CEST. During these workshops we go over highlights or latest released features for XtendM3 and topics requested in the Teams Community or last workshop. At the end of each workshop we have a round table session where the floor is open to any questions, discussions or requests.

## XtendM3 Teams Community
In Microsoft Teams, we have a Team setup named __*XtendM3 Community*__. This Team is used for several things, divided up by channel name these are:
- Resources, both recordings of the workshop and the slides are uploaded after each workshop
- Support, general XtendM3 support
- Feature Requests, XtendM3 specific feature requests can be posted here
- Workshop Topic Request, requests for topics to be presented on next Workshop
